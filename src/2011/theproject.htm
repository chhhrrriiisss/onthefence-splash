                      There are barriers to politics for young people.</p>
                    <p class="plainText">The emerging generation has had more chances than ever before to engage with how Governments are run, through the fluidity and freedom of social-media driven technology and the pace of modern day communication. It's interesting to see that despite this accessibility, there is still a large portion of young people who have never voted or make ill informed decisions and waste their vote.</p>
                    <p class="plainText">Our strategy to approach this problem revolves around the concept of interactivity. The intention of our solution is to enable people to allot value to certain areas of concern, while being cleverly immersed within a story or gameplay narrative. </p>
                    <p class="plainText">Such an environment promotes a much more intuitive and fun experience than traditional forced-choice questions. By projecting themselves into the experience, the project remains non-partisan and enables the user to project their values to see how they compare with the political parties.</p>

                      On the Fence is a metaphor for being undecided. Sheep have a distinct relevance to kiwi culture.</p>
          <p class="plainText">In principle, there is a lack of interactivity in Politics, especially at election time. It is still broadcast-driven, only once every three years are constituents able to have their say; it is plain to see that a trend is emerging. Politics is uninteresting and there is a group mentality, lack of individuality and personal responsibility is especially prevalent amongst first time voters, in the late teen/early 20's age group. Younger people in our peer group don't see voting as enjoyable and it has no shaping influence in their lives. <strong></strong></p>
          <p class="plainText">On the Fence is an opportunity to put 'trainer wheels' on the future for them. We aim to encourage the user to take control and search for knowledge themselves, by pushing the idea of a game we want to engage people so that they can discover, learn and absorb a more political world view.</p>

          <p class="plainText">After analysing the overall structure and process that was needed in order to get the user's political recommendation back to them, we soon determined that using a factual or question-orientated approach to filtering out their preferences was inadequate. A forced-choice question based approach is in many ways a soft interrogation and that makes the overall experience less fun and less engaging. An important consideration was putting the statements in a language that a political novice may begin to understand - not by dumbing down their significance, but by explaining their fundamentals in as simple a manner as possible. They could not be too long because of typographic restraints, but more importantly: the user may become confused. </p> <p class="plainText">Our process of determining value for each of the policy areas to compare user data to starts with the web application we have built to gather back-end data. It works in much of the same way a statement may be polled by the media or by the Electoral Commission. Rather than using a binary yes/no system, the sliders enable the user to position themselves relatively to each statement. Rather than agree or disagree with one, they could be shades of either. In order to keep the average values as true as possible, we are have sought feedback from a varied consensus of academics, scholars and professionals. These include Politics and Humanities lecturers and researchers from Victoria University, Senior Tutors and Lecturers from Massey University, Educational Psychologists, Research Laboratory Scientists, leaders from young political parties such as Young Nat's &amp; Young Labour and more. In the process of consultation, the statements have been refined to the ones currently used in the application.</p>

By agreeing or disagreeing with both, the User is, in effect, agreeing or disagreeing with neither; the value remains at 50.
