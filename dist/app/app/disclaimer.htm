<h1>YOUR RESULTS</h1>
<p class="highlight">While we've done our best to ensure that the tool is as <br /> non-partisan and transparent as it can be - please respect the fact that it might not calculate what you expect!</p><p>There are currently seven possible parties that can be offered as a suggestion - Green, Mana, Maori, National, Labour and United Future. We have tried to obtain Act's approval, however they have declined to take part (legally, we need permission from each party before we can suggest you vote for them). </p>

<p>The actual values for each party are not calculated by us, but by our specialist panel - who are senior academics and commentators very knowledgeable in their field. We'd like to be clear to everyone that we have taken no part in the process of assigning where each party should be relevant to each statement - the data is entirely the averaged viewpoint of the political panel.</p>

<p>We will be releasing graphs and a bit more background on where our data is coming from in the hope that it will explain why people are getting the results they are getting. A lot of it has to do with how close a lot of parties' values are in relation to each other over the spread of certain policy areas, for some its just a case of not knowing the party as well as you think you do!</p>

<p>In the meantime you can find out a bit more about the background to the project and our panel by going to <a href="../theproject.htm" target="_new">our project page</a>.</p>

<h1>IT'S A PROTOTYPE!</h1>
<p class="highlight">We recognize that being the first of its kind, this tool is very experimental - so please don't scream at us - all we want is your feedback so we can make it better!</p>

<p>We hope that this tool is handy for some, but we don't expect that it will work for everyone. That's exactly why we are so interested in your feedback - because we know that with your help we can make something like this better for future elections. Something that every young voter can use to get a kickstart into politics and something that will benefit democracy as a whole with better, more educated voting choices!</p>

<h1>LEGAL</h1>
<p class="highlight">While supported by Massey University, the opinions and views expressed are not representative.</p>
<p>The website and application provided by On the Fence began as a project briefed within the 300-level Design & Business paper at the Massey University Institute of Communication Design in Wellington. All five 3rd year design students have successfully completed the paper in 2011. 
<p>The project has rolled outside of the University's purview, but has the Institute's support as an independent design exploration by its students. It remains a prototype and the views expressed do not represent those of the University. All reasonable measures have been taken to remain non-partisan and transparent with all participants and representatives from the Electoral Commission.</p>

<p>We'll get back to you as soon as we can!</p>
